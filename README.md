## Introduction
This is a repository with a native IOS application integrated with the Customer Glu SDK.  

## Motivation
We created this application so you could get a better understanding on how to integrate our SDK into your app! 
From developer to developer, we know that real code examples sometimes are more valuable than documentation itself.

## How to run the app
1. Clone this repository
2. [Install Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
3. Run `pod install` 
4. [Integrate with firebase](#firebase)
5. Run the app through Xcode

### Integrate with firebase
Customer Glu SDK depends on a firebase project to reach the full potential. 

1. Go to your [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
2. Go to project settings
3. Scroll down to `Your apps` and select IOS
4. Follow the instructions. We only need to complete the step `Download config file`, the rest has already been completed in this repository.
